 <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>For the cornish game hen</strong></li>
 <li>Preheat the oven at 450º and position the rack in the middle of the oven.</li>
 <li>Place a hen, breast side down on a cutting board. Remove the backbone by cutting along both sides with shears or a large sharp knife.</li>
 <li>Flip the hen and flatten it by pressing down on the breastbone with your palm. Split the hen in two along the breastbone. Repeat with the remaining hen.</li>
 <li>Place on a heavy roasting pan and spread on each half, ¼ of a teaspoon of butter, Herbs de Provence, salt and pepper, and a drop of olive oil. Place in the hot oven and cook for 30 to 45 minutes. Poke the hen while cooking to release any juices.</li>
 <li>When done, remove from the oven, place the hen in a dish and cover with aluminum foil and let rest.</li>
    <li><strong>For the whiskey and cream sauce</strong></li>
 <li>Place the unwashed cooking pan over the stove and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and let it melt. Lower the heat and add the whiskey, very slowly. With a wooden spoon scrape up any bit on the pan.</li>
 <li>Add the shallots and cook until tender, 1 minute. Add the Worcestershire sauce, mustard and raise the heat to medium-high. Bring to a boil stirring constantly</li>
 <li>Add the heavy cream and the lemon juice. Taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper.</li>
 <li>Serve hot over the Cornish hen.</li>
 <li>Serve the Cornish game hens with the whiskey cream sauce drizzled over the top.</li>
    </ol>
